#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`791` Add a new ``run.echo_format``"
#~ " configuration option allowing control over"
#~ " the format of echoed commands. It"
#~ " defaults to the previously hardcoded "
#~ "value (wrap in ANSI bold) and is"
#~ " thus backwards compatible. Thanks to "
#~ "David JM Emmett for the patch."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":support:`- backported` Document the ``dry``"
#~ " keyword argument to ``run``, which "
#~ "had been added in version 1.3 but"
#~ " only documented as a CLI flag; "
#~ "it does also work as a kwarg "
#~ "(and as a config option)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":support:`- backported` (Mostly) alphabetize "
#~ "the list of ``run()`` params in "
#~ "the runners API docs. Previously they"
#~ " were an unordered mess."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`751` Don't explode on empty-"
#~ "but-for-whitespace task docstrings. Thanks"
#~ " to Matt Hayden for the report "
#~ "& initial patches."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`-` Upgrade `~invoke.context.MockContext` "
#~ "to wrap its methods in ``Mock`` "
#~ "objects if the ``(unittest.)mock`` library "
#~ "is importable. This makes testing "
#~ "Invoke-using codebases even easier."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`700` Automatically populate the "
#~ "``command`` attribute of `~invoke.runners.Result`"
#~ " objects returned by "
#~ "`~invoke.context.MockContext` methods, with the "
#~ "command string triggering that result. "
#~ "Previously users had to do this by"
#~ " hand or otherwise suffered inaccurate "
#~ "result objects. Thanks to ``@SwampFalc`` "
#~ "for the report & initial patch."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`441` Add a new ``repeat`` "
#~ "kwarg to `~invoke.context.MockContext` which, "
#~ "when True (default: False) causes stored"
#~ " results for its methods to be "
#~ "yielded repeatedly instead of consumed. "
#~ "Feature request courtesy of ``@SwampFalc``."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`-` `~invoke.context.MockContext` now "
#~ "accepts a few quality-of-life "
#~ "shortcuts as keys and values in "
#~ "its ``run``/``sudo`` arguments:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Keys may be compiled regular expression"
#~ " objects, as well as strings, and "
#~ "will match any calls whose commands "
#~ "match the regex."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Values may be ``True`` or ``False`` "
#~ "as shorthand for otherwise empty "
#~ "`~invoke.runners.Result` objects with exit "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Values may also be strings, as "
#~ "shorthand for otherwise empty "
#~ "`~invoke.runners.Result` objects with those "
#~ "strings given as the ``stdout`` "
#~ "argument."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`-` `~invoke.context.MockContext` now "
#~ "populates its ``NotImplementedError`` exception "
#~ "instances (typically raised when a "
#~ "command is executed which had no "
#~ "pre-prepared result) with the command "
#~ "string that triggered them; this makes"
#~ " it much easier to tell what "
#~ "exactly in a test caused the "
#~ "error."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`197` Allow subcollections to act "
#~ "as the default 'tasks' of their "
#~ "parent collections (via the new "
#~ "``default`` kwarg to "
#~ "`~invoke.collection.Collection.add_collection`). This "
#~ "means that nontrivial task trees can "
#~ "specify eg \"use my test subcollection's"
#~ " default task as the global default"
#~ " task\" and similar. Thanks to Tye"

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`- major` Immutable iterable result "
#~ "values handed to `~invoke.context.MockContext` "

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":support:`586 backported` Explicitly strip out"
#~ " ``__pycache__`` (and for good measure, "
#~ "``.py[co]``, which previously we only "
#~ "stripped from the ``tests/`` folder) in"
#~ " our ``MANIFEST.in``, since at least "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":support:`-` Update the :ref:`testing "
#~ "documentation <testing-user-code>` a "
#~ "bit: cleaned up existing examples and"
#~ " added new sections for the other "
#~ "updates in the 1.5 release."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ ":support:`-` Enhanced test coverage in a"
#~ " handful of modules whose coverage "
#~ "was under 90%."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`518` Close pseudoterminals opened by "
#~ "the `~invoke.runners.Local` class during "
#~ "``run(..., pty=True)``. Previously, these were"
#~ " only closed incidentally at process "
#~ "shutdown, causing file descriptor leakage "
#~ "in long-running processes. Thanks to "
#~ "Jonathan Paulson for the report."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`660` Fix an issue with "
#~ "`~invoke.run` & friends having intermittent"
#~ " problems at exit time (symptom was"
#~ " typically about the exit code value"
#~ " being ``None`` instead of an "
#~ "integer; often with an exception trace)."
#~ " Thanks to Frank Lazzarini for the"
#~ " report and to the numerous others"
#~ " who provided reproduction cases."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`-` Never accompanied the top-"
#~ "level singleton `~invoke.run` (which simply"
#~ " wraps an anonymous `~invoke.context.Context`'s"
#~ " ``run`` method) with its logical "
#~ "sibling, `~invoke.sudo` - this has been"
#~ " remedied."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`682` (originally reported as "
#~ ":issue:`194`) Add asynchronous behavior to "
#~ "`~invoke.runners.Runner.run`:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Basic asynchronicity, where the method "
#~ "returns as soon as the subprocess "
#~ "has started running, and that return "
#~ "value is an object with methods "
#~ "allowing access to the final result."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "\"Disowning\" subprocesses entirely, which not"

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`- major` As part of feature "
#~ "work on :issue:`682`, we noticed that"
#~ " the `~invoke.runners.Result` return value "
#~ "from `~invoke.context.Context.run` was inconsistent"
#~ " between dry-run and regular modes;"
#~ " for example, the dry-run version "
#~ "of the object lacked updated values "
#~ "for ``hide``, ``encoding`` and ``env``. "
#~ "This has been fixed."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`637 major` A corner case in "
#~ "`~invoke.context.Context.run` caused overridden "
#~ "streams to be unused if those "
#~ "streams were also set to be hidden"
#~ " (eg ``run(command, hide=True, "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`-` Allow the configuration system"
#~ " to override which `~invoke.executor.Executor`"
#~ " subclass to use when executing tasks"
#~ " (via an import-oriented string)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Specifically, it's now possible to alter"
#~ " execution by distributing such a "
#~ "subclass alongside, for example, a "
#~ "repository-local config file which sets "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":feature:`539` (via :issue:`645`) Add support"
#~ " for command timeouts, i.e. the "

#~ "`~invoke.context.Context.run` may take to "
#~ "execute. Specifically:"

#~ ":feature:`324` Add basic dry-run "
#~ "support, in the form of a new "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`466 major` Update the parsing and"
#~ " CLI-program mechanisms so that all"
#~ " core arguments may be given within"
#~ " task CLI contexts; previously this "
#~ "functionality only worked for the "
#~ "``--help`` flag, and other core "

#~ ":bug:`557 major` (with assist from "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`552 major` (also :issue:`553`) Add "
#~ "a new `~invoke.runners.Runner` method, "

#~ "the report & initial patch."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This fix only applies when ``pty=False``"

#~ "situation greatly (but also mean the "
#~ "issue is less likely to occur)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ ":bug:`384 major` (via :issue:`653`) Modify "
#~ "config file loading so it detects "
