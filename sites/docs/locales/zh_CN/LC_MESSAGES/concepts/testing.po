"A quick foreword: most users will find the subsequent approaches "
"suitable, but advanced users should note that Invoke has been designed so"
" it is itself easily testable. This means that in many cases, even "
"Invoke's \"internals\" are exposed as low/no-shared-responsibility, "
"publicly documented classes which can be subclassed and modified to "
"inject test-friendly values or mocks. Be sure to look over the :ref:`API "
"documentation <api>`!"
msgstr ""
"简短的序言：大多数用户会发现后续的方法适用，但高级用户应注意，Invoke 的设计使其本身易于测试。"
"这意味着在许多情况下，甚至 Invoke 的‘内部’组件也暴露为低/无共享责任的、公开记录的类，"
"可以被子类化和修改以注入测试友好的值或模拟对象。请务必查看 :ref:`API 文档 <api>`！"

"An instance of subclassing Invoke's public API for test purposes is our "

msgid ""
"Starting in Invoke 1.5, `.MockContext` will attempt to import the "
"``mock`` library at instantiation time and wrap its methods within "
"``Mock`` objects. This lets you not only present realistic return values "

"The test code (again, which presumes that eg ``MockContext.run`` is now a"

"methods you need. It also shows how you can set the mock context to "

"You may have noticed the above example uses a handful of 'empty' "

#: ../../concepts/testing.rst:112
msgid ""
"This is relatively common - think \"interrogative\" commands where the "
"caller only cares for a boolean result, or times when a command is called"
" purely for its side effects. To support this, there's a shorthand in "
"`.MockContext`: passing ``True`` or ``False`` to stand in for otherwise "
"blank Results with exit codes of ``0`` or ``1`` respectively."

"first positional arg of `.Result`!) but \"command X results in stdout Y\""
