"Command-line programs tend to be designed for interactive shells, which "
"frequently manifests as waiting around for user input, or \"prompts\". "
"Well-designed programs offer options for pre-empting such prompts, "
"resulting in an easily automated workflow -- but with the rest, "
"interactivity is unavoidable."

"Thankfully, Invoke's `.Runner` class not only forwards your standard "
"input to the running program (allowing you to manually respond to "
"prompts) but it can also be configured to respond automatically on your "
"behalf."

"The mechanism for this automation is the ``watchers`` kwarg to the "
"`.Runner.run` method (and its wrappers elsewhere, such as `.Context.run` "
"and `invoke.run`), which is a list of `.StreamWatcher`-subclass instances"
" configured to watch for patterns & respond accordingly. The simplest of "
"these is `.Responder`, which just replies with its configured response "
"every time its pattern is seen; others can be found in the :doc:`watchers"
" module </api/watchers>`."

"As with all other arguments to ``run``, you can also set the default set "

"Take for example this program which expects a manual response to a yes/no"

"You *could* call ``run(\"excitable-program\")``, manually watch for the "
"prompt, and mash Y by hand. But if you instead supply a `.Responder` like"
" so::"

"Then `.Runner` passes the program's ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` through "
"``responder``, which watches for ``\"Are you ready? [Y/n] \"`` and "
"automatically writes ``y`` (plus ``\\n`` to simulate hitting "
"Enter/Return) to the program's ``stdin``."

"The pattern argument to `.Responder` is treated as a `regular expression "
"<re>`, requiring more care (note how we had to escape our square-brackets"
" in the above example) but providing more power as well."
